# Underwater-Surveillance
This project aims to solve the visual surveillance problem in underwater scenario. Surveillance means detection of the object(s) to be tracked and then locating them in subsequent frames or time instants. This repository will include all the software/code we have developed and  will be available for the research and academic usage.
Open the .pro file and click on the RUN button. You will get a GUI.
